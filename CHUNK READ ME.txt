Chunking implemented by Lewis Ghrist

For each chunk, to check if a block face should be drawn or not, I reused the set of face normals to get the adjacent block and check if it was EMPTY or not. Additionally, if a block was at the edge of the chunk, it would jump over to the next chunk to get the block. To draw the faces, I had a mapping of directions to an array of four points which made up the positions of a unit cube at 0,0,0. These positions were then multiplied by a translation matrix based on the position of the chunk and the position of the block in that chunk. All VBO data was pushed in the same interleaved format (pos, nor, col), whcih got spereated out in the new draw function.
